Annotate the web, by the element.

Acetate is being re-built from the ground up using new tech, and less trial and error, compared to my Dissertation project

Here's the [original dissertation repo](https://github.com/SamReeve96/Acetate-Dissertation-Prototype-), just incase you're feeling nostalgic or curious about how this project started.

## What is Acetate

Acetate is a browser extension (Currently targeting Chromium browsers for now, get in touch if Firefox or Safari etc. would be something you'd want to help with!) that allows users to markup webpages for several use cases. Acetate connects comments to the element in context.
